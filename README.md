Created on the 4th of March, 2023

pig-game is a two-player game. You can play the game at <a href="https://waysidebaker57.github.io/pig-game">waysidebaker57.github.io/pig-game</a>.
## How to play
The gameplay of <a href="https://github.com/WaysideBaker57/pig-game/">pig-game</a> can be split into three concepts: rolling, holding, and winning.

### Rolling
Click on the "🎲 ROLL DICE" button to roll the dice. Whatever is rolled will be added to the current score of the active player.
Rolling a one will reset the current score and switch to the next player.

### Holding
Clicking on the "📥 HOLD" button to add the current score of the active player to the total score. This is done to prevent loss of score by rolling a one (Don't want to lose those valuable points now, do you? 😜).

### Winning 🎉
The game is won by the first player to reach 100 in their total score. The player tab of the winning player changes color to #2F2F2F or jet black (if you must).

## Restarting the game
I believe that a good look 🕵 at the game interface will tell you how to restart game but I will explain anyway.
Click on the "🔄 NEW GAME" button to restart the game. This can be done at any point in the game.

## Dev's Note 👨‍💻
This is a fun game to play with a friend and I would advice you try it.
